AEMR Analysis:

The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) is responsible for looking after the United States of Americaâ€™s domestic energy network.
Of the four outage types, the only one that AEMR penalizes is a forced outage.
If the number of forced outage state increased and if the demand of energy is greater than the actual supply, stress will be put on energy system.
This will then threaten the reliability of the network which is what the AEMR wishes to avoid.

Data from 2016-2017 reflects two following major concerns, which we will be analysing in this case study.

A) Energy Stability and Market Outages
B) Energy Losses and Market Reliability
